# Energy-Consumption-Time-Series-Analysis


This project offers a comprehensive examination and analysis of hourly energy consumption data. By leveraging sophisticated time series analysis techniques, it offers predictive insights into future energy consumption trends.

## Overview

The primary objective of this project was to predict future energy consumption based on historical hourly energy usage data. To achieve this, the project was divided into several key stages, each contributing towards achieving the overall objective.

## Detailed Description

1. **Data Loading and Preparation:** This initial stage involved loading the energy consumption dataset and conducting necessary preprocessing. The preprocessing steps included setting up the correct datetime index for the time series data.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** In this phase, the dataset underwent thorough analysis to uncover underlying patterns, anomalies, or other insights. Various data visualization techniques were utilized to better understand the distribution and trends in the data.

3. **Feature Engineering:** To enhance the predictive power of the machine learning models, new features were derived from existing data. These included time-based features such as hour of the day, day of the week, quarter of the year, etc.

4. **Model Training and Hyperparameter Tuning:** Three distinct predictive models were trained on the dataset - XGBoost, ARIMA, and LSTM. These models were selected due to their robustness in dealing with time-series data. A grid search approach was employed to optimize the XGBoost model's hyperparameters, improving its prediction capability.

5. **Model Evaluation:** The performance of each model was evaluated using standard error metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). This allowed for a comparative study of each model's prediction accuracy.

6. **Prediction and Visualization:** The models' predictive performance was visualized through a series of plots comparing actual versus predicted energy consumption. Additionally, feature importance for the best performing model was evaluated and visualized to provide insights into the factors that most significantly influenced the predictions.

7. **Forecasting:** Using the best-performing model, future energy consumption values were forecasted. This forecasting capability is crucial for future energy planning and management.

This project demonstrates the power of time series analysis in predicting future trends based on historical data, offering valuable insights for decision-makers in the energy sector.
